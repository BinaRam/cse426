# CSE4/526 Blockchain Application Development   Fall 2023

## Short Description
This course is intended for students interested in learning about blockchain technology and developing applications using blockchain concepts. It begins with defining the blockchain as a trust layer over the internet. Blockchain and its web called web3 are for working with distributed resources and decentralized and disintermediated control. For the first part of the course, the topics covered include the definition of a blockchain in terms of transactions, blocks, chain of blocks, data structures enabling the blockchain protocol, and operational details involving algorithms and techniques such as peer-to-peer transactions, cryptography, digital signing and hashing, and consensus mechanisms. All of these concepts will be illustrated using Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. In the second part of the course, we introduce the idea of code execution on the blockchain and the program module called smart contract and a language, Solidity, for writing smart contracts, compiling, deploying, and testing the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The course's last part combines the concepts into a decentralized application (Dapp) stack and explores problem-solving using blockchain. This process involves designing and developing a Dapp stack with the computational logic represented by the smart contract code, a user interface, and support for external data access through oracles and decentralized file systems. Students will work on hands-on end-to-end Dapp projects using the Ethereum blockchain and Truffle integrated development environment (IDE). The course will also discuss standards, best practices, current challenges, scalability and interoperability, and solutions. On completion of the course, a student will analyze a problem and develop and implement an end-to-end blockchain solution on the Ethereum blockchain.
New this semester is a focus on Layer 2 and NFT (both on Ethereum-based networks), the new roles for decentralized systems and applications enabling the participation of all.

## Course Outcomes
Upon completing this course, a student will be able to design and implement a smart contract and a blockchain-based decentralized web application (Dapp) and work with web3 technologies. Students will have
good understanding and working knowledge of the cryptocurrency ecosystems.

## Grading Policy
Grading Distribution
Final letter grades will be based on the (combined) overall percentage of all the items listed below. A (95 -- ), A- (90
-- 94), B+ (85 -- 89), B (80 -- 84), B- (75 -- 79), C+ (70 -- 74), C (64 -- 69), C- (55 -- 64), D (50 --
54), F (less than 50). This policy is subject to change. If needed, the individual components and the overall grades
will be appropriately curved.

### Grade components

| Component (Quantity) | Points |
 |---------------------| :----------|
| Attendance including pop quiz | 100 |
| Project (1) | 100 |
| Exam 1 (1) | 100 |
| Exam 2 (1) | 100 |

## Project
You will work on one project with multiple phases. This strategy will allow for incremental development and manage your workload appropriately spread over the semester rather than rushing and panicking at the end of the semester. The due date for each project phase will be announced when it is assigned. All the source code, documentation, makefile,
data files, and README files will be submitted online. The details of submission will be given along with your first
project phase. You will have to follow the rules for the other phases too.
I reserve the right to change the project specifications at any point before the due date to address problems that may
arise during the project. The changes will be easy to implement if your design is modular. A detailed grading guideline will be given to you, along with the project specification. Use this as a guide for your
design and implementation. It is necessary to keep up with the lecture material in the class to complete the project and perform well in the exams. No late assignments will be accepted. Keep submitting partial project material as you develop them.
Develop your code using incremental development technique. Do not try to code the entire
assignment in one sitting. Instead, take one section at a time, implement, test it, back up the code, and move on to
the next section. You will turn in each phase before 11:59 PM on the due date via the departmental submit command.
You must also include appropriate testing programs to show the validity of your solution. In addition, you must
include external documentation discussing the “hows and whys” of your design and implementation. You will be
required to demonstrate your lab to your TA. The TA will test examples against your code to check your
solution’s correctness. The TA will provide a demo schedule. You are responsible for demoing your project,
or you will receive a zero for that portion of the grade.
When your grade is assigned for the project phases, the TA will indicate critical areas that must be fixed to solve the
next phases. 

## Exams and quizzes
There will be a midterm that will be administered and graded before the resignation date. Exam 1 will cover all lecture
and reading assignments before the exam and concepts from the lab assignments. Exam 2 is a
comprehensive exam covering all lectures, labs, and homework areas. All exams are closed books, closed notes, and
closed neighbors. We do not give makeup exams for any reason. If you miss an exam, you will receive a zero for
that portion of the grade.

Quizzes will be pop quizzes and may be unannounced. No makeup quizzes will be given.

## Attendance Policy
You are responsible for the contents of all lectures and recitations (your assigned section). If you know you will miss a lecture or a recitation, have a reliable friend take notes for you. Of course, there is no excuse for
missing due dates or exam days. Attendance will be taken and will determine the attendance grade component to compute your final grade.

During lectures, we will be covering material from the textbook. We will also work out several of the problems
from the text. Lectures will feature exploring several real-world problems not covered in the book.
Lecture dynamics will depend very much on students' participation, and students are strongly encouraged to ask
questions related to the material covered in the class. You will be given a reading assignment for the next class at the end of each
lecture.
 
Office hours are designed to review complex class concepts and spend additional time discussing the lab
work required for the course. This time is your time to communicate with your TA about the course, project, exams, quizzes, etc. Use the
opportunity to the fullest.

## Office Hour Policy
If you can't meet during the designated office hours, you will have to communicate via Email. Office hours are intended to
resolve questions about the material that could not be answered in lectures or recitation. Come to office hours
prepared! Office hours are NOT for repeating missed lecture material or having the instructor or TA solve an assigned problem for you. We will NOT write
or debug your code for you during office hours! Instead, we will direct you to where to concentrate your debugging efforts.

## Grading Policy
All assignments will be graded and returned promptly. When an assignment is returned, you will have one week to contest any portion of the grade. The TA who graded your project will be the first 
to resolve a grading conflict. The instructor will mediate the dispute if the conflict cannot be resolved. The
judgment of the instructor will be final in all such cases. When contesting a grade, you must demonstrate
how your particular solution is correct. Also, when contesting a grade, the instructor or TA reserves the right to reevaluate the entire lab or exam, not just the portion in dispute.

## Incomplete Policy
We only grant incompletes in this course under the direst of circumstances. An incomplete is
warranted if the student cannot complete the course satisfactorily, such as a traumatic event that has interfered
with their ability to finish within the semester's timeframe. Incompletes are not designed as a stalling tactic to
defer a poor performance in a class.

## Academic Integrity Policy
UB’s definition of Academic Integrity in part is, “Students are responsible for the honest completion and
representation of their work.” It is required as part of this course that you read and understand the departmental
academic integrity policy located at the following URL:
https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/information-for-faculty-and-staff/academicintegrity.html
There is a fine line separating conversations about concepts and academic dishonesty. You are allowed
to converse about general ideas, but in no way are you allowed to share code or have one person do the work for
others. You must abide by the UB and Departmental Academic Integrity policy at all times. NOTE: Remember
that the academic integrity policy also covers items taken from the Internet! If you are unsure if a particular
action violates the academic integrity policy, assume that it does until you receive clarification from the instructor.

## Ublearns and Piazza
The CSE426/526 ublearns should be checked frequently for important news. Course assignments, slides, grade reporting,
and general hints and tips will be posted on the ublearns blackboard LMS system. There is a licensed version of piazza for your class discussions. Please enroll in it and make the best use of it. Piazza is only for any public discussion related to the course, so be civil. Also, do not post any code publicly on Pizza. Piazza cannot solve any individual grading question. In this case, you should contact your TA or the instructor for grading questions.

## Students with Accessibility Issues
If you have special needs due to a disability, you must be registered with the Office of Student Accessibility. If you
are registered with them, please let your instructors know about this so that they can make special arrangements for
you.

## Piracy and illegal use of course material

All materials I prepared and/or assigned for this course are for the students’ educational
benefit. Other than for permitted collaborative work, students may not photograph, record,
reproduce, transmit, distribute, upload, sell or exchange course materials without my prior
written permission. “Course materials” include, but are not limited to, all instructor-prepared and
assigned materials, such as lectures; lecture notes; discussion prompts; study aids; tests and
assignments; and presentation materials such as PowerPoint slides, Prezi slides, or transparencies;
and course packets or handouts. Public distribution of such materials may also constitute
copyright infringement in violation of federal or state law. Violation of this policy may additionally
subject a student to a finding of “academic dishonesty” under the Academic Integrity Policy
and/or disciplinary charges under the Student Code of Conduct.


### Violations
Students who violate this policy will be required to complete an educational sanction about the
value of intellectual property. More serious and/or repeat violations of this policy may be
treated as acts of “academic dishonesty” under the Academic Integrity Policy at
(https://www.buffalo.edu/academic-integrity/policies.html) or subject a student to disciplinary
charges under the Student Code of Conduct.
